# Technical Route

## Product Thesis

Build a local-first file converter that people can trust with private files.
The project should win on honesty, stability, and performance instead of
claiming every format works.

## Phase 0: Native Shell

Goal: prove the Android project structure works before adding heavy libraries.

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose.
- One activity.
- No-op conversion engine.
- Support matrix and dependency policy in the repository.
- No FFmpegKit dependency at this phase.

Success: the app builds, opens on a physical device, and the placeholder UI is
visible.

## Phase 1: Real Task Pipeline

Goal: make conversion jobs observable and cancelable before real transcoding.

- File picker through Storage Access Framework.
- `ConversionRequest`, `ConversionEvent`, and task registry.
- ViewModel with StateFlow.
- Foreground service skeleton.
- Notification progress for long-running jobs.

Success: a selected file can create a no-op job, show progress, and finish.

## Phase 2: Retired Hardware Media Path

Original goal: support one high-value 4K-safe path using maintained Android
hardware APIs.

This phase was useful as the first real video experiment, but it is no longer
an active engine in the app. It was retired after the FFmpeg path became the
single connected route for MP4/MKV/MOV video outputs and audio outputs, because
hidden engine switching made options and advanced filters harder to reason
about.

Future hardware acceleration should return only as an explicit user-visible
mode, not as an automatic fallback.

## Phase 3: FFmpeg Compatibility Path

Goal: add flexible media conversion with one predictable audio/video engine.

- Choose one maintained FFmpeg Android strategy:
  - maintained FFmpegKit fork,
  - self-built FFmpeg AAR,
  - or another actively maintained wrapper.
- Record license flags before shipping binaries.
- Start with MP4 to MP3, non-MP4 video to MP4 re-encode, MP4 to MKV
  re-encode, and MOV output.
- Use file descriptors or SAF-aware APIs when available.

Success: FFmpeg jobs run from Kotlin, report progress, and do not require
duplicating normal local files into cache.

Current FFmpeg path: a self-built `arthenica/ffmpeg-kit-next` `v7.1.0` AAR
handles MP4/MKV/MOV video re-encode, video-to-GIF output, video-file audio
extraction, and MP3/M4A/WAV/FLAC/WMA/OPUS audio targets through FFmpeg
arguments. MP3, Opus, and FLAC audio targets now take a bounded metadata
snapshot and verify common fields, one JPEG/PNG primary cover, and ordinary
lyrics in the native output container. MP3 repair writes a true ID3 `USLT`
without touching audio frames; Opus and FLAC may use one metadata-only
`-c:a copy` remux. Required verification failure stops the task. Trimmed/split
outputs drop chapters whose source timestamps are no longer valid. The
metadata-specific arm64 physical-device acceptance matrix remains pending.
The advanced filter set is also verified for MP4/MKV/MOV video outputs and
audio outputs: video reverse playback, fade, mirror, rotate, frame fit/crop;
audio reverse playback, non-model `afftdn` noise reduction, volume/mute, fade,
and echo. Video reverse is limited to inputs with readable duration and size
metadata, up to 60 seconds, and within a conservative reverse-frame memory
budget. The current AAR is `arm64-v8a` only, and the app probes needed encoders
and selected filters before export where possible so a wrong package fails
clearly. This is intentionally not universal video or audio transcoding:
unsupported codecs, streams, and device/file-provider limits remain explicit in
the support matrix.

## Phase 4: Image, PDF, Archive

Goal: expand only after media task reliability exists.

- Image: JPG, PNG, WEBP, HEIC where feasible.
- PDF: images to PDF, PDF to images, merge and split.
- Archive: ZIP first, then 7Z/RAR extraction if licensing allows.

Success: every new format appears in `formats/support-matrix.md` with tested
examples and known limits.

## Phase 5: Distribution

Goal: stay low-maintenance and open.

- GitHub Releases APK.
- F-Droid metadata if feasible.
- Optional website later.
- China mainland app stores are not a V1 target.

Success: users can install without a store account and inspect the source.
